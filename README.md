# tensorflow-exp
tensorflow experiments and files. Not to be confused with the actual library, which the files do use.

recommended to place mnist.py and input_data.py and __init__.py in the package directory of tensorflow:
path/to/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist

The softmax_mnist.py lives somewhere else of your choice.
